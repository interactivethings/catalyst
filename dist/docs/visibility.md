# Visibility

> To hide a piece of content for a particular device size or screen orientation, Catalyst provides visibility classes. Hiding a block, a `div` or even a single character depending on screen size lets you provide an optimized experience.

## Hiding elements

Hide helper classes allow to force hide an element. They accept several modifiers as shown below. Most of those modifiers depend on media queries, hence you might want to alter the viewport for testing. Available helpers:

* `hide` — hides an element for all displays
* `s-hide` — hides an element for small and bigger displays
* `m-hide` — hides an element for medium and bigger displays
* `l-hide` — hides an element for large and bigger displays
* `h-hide` — hides an element for displays in horizontal (landscape) mode
* `v-hide` — hides an element for displays in vertical (portrait) mode
